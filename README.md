Hello!

I am pharmacology researcher studying the relationship between environmental toxins and cardiovascular
health. The current state of data analysis in the traditional academic lab is inefficient and flawed.
I have taken the initiative to learn and develop skills in computer science and machine learning over
the past year, and I hope to further my knowledge and ability with the help of the GitHub community.
